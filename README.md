Dataset Link - https://data.world/thatzprem/agriculture-india

This dataset (crop_production.csv) provides comprehensive data on crop production across various states, districts, crops, and seasons in India. Key numerical insights include a range of crop years from 1997 to 2015, areas ranging widely from 0.04 to 8,580,100 hectares, and production values varying from 0 to 1,250,800,000 units. Missing values were identified in the production column (3,730 entries) and handled appropriately. Visualizations depict the distribution of area and production, state-wise and season-wise crop counts, and top crops and districts by frequency. Correlation analysis highlighted relationships among crop year, area, and production. Trend analysis revealed fluctuating production trends over years, while seasonal analysis showcased production variations across different seasons. Geographical analysis illustrated total crop production by state, indicating notable production disparities. These insights inform potential strategies for further analysis and modeling.
